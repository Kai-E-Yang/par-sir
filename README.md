# par-sir
**Parallel SIR Stokes synthesis from MURaM cubes**
**par-sir** is tested and optimized for HPC MPI execution using gfortran or Intel compilers and includes support for batch job submission in PBS and Slurm.

**par-sir** is derived from, and depends upon, the [3d_sir code](https://github.com/aasensio/3d_sir): Copyright (c) 2018 Andr√©s Asensio Ramos
The 3d_sir code is included a submodule of **par-sir** with code overlays in the synth subdirectory.

**Note regarding MURaM cube and 3d_sir axes**
The MURaM simulation uses a solar Y, X, Z reference frame. This is the order the axes are written to disk.
The 3d_sir ini file parsing has been modified to allow explicit declaration of the ordering in the cube of the solar cartesian coordinate axes using:
- **Type** ` Type = 'MURAM'`
- **XYZ** `XYZ = 1, 0, 2`
- **Dimensions** `Dimensions = 1536, 1536, 128`
This configuration specifies that Solar Y (+=North,-=South) is MURaM axis 0, Solar X (+=West,-=East) is MURaM axis 1 and Line of Sight (Z) is MURaM axis 2. 

**Note regarding LINEAS**
